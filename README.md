A full-stack Databricks App for account-level compute cost visibility, chargeback, and anomaly detection across your entire Databricks platform.

Built on FastAPI + React, deployed as a [Databricks App](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/index.html) with service principal authentication and serverless compute built in. Supports **multi-cloud deployment** across AWS, Azure, and GCP with automatic cloud detection.

---

## What's changed in the new deployment model

- **Setup is simpler.** The SQL warehouse is bound as an Apps resource and injected as `DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID`. Workspace scoping is controlled with `COST_OBS_WORKSPACES`. Customers no longer need to select a warehouse or change workspace scope inside the app UI.

- **Fake zeros are gone.** If a required grant is missing, the app shows that the affected metric is unavailable and points to the fix — instead of rendering a misleading $0.00 value.

- **Setup experience is consistent across tabs.** Permissions, config, and readiness share the same underlying state so customers do not see one tab report healthy while another shows stale errors after a grant or rebuild.

- **Diagnostics surface actionable next steps.** Instead of raw error details, the app maps failures to specific actions — **Grant SQL**, **Rebuild**, or **Configure** — so customers can move directly to the fix.

**Deploy from Git** is the recommended deployment path. The app's first-run flow is built around an environment check, permissions check, and table creation step.

---

## Deployment

### Setup Requirements

#### Required

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Databricks workspace with Apps enabled** | Deploy from Git is available in supported workspaces with Databricks Apps enabled |
| **Unity Catalog enabled** | Required — the app reads from UC system tables and stores app-managed tables in UC |
| **Access to core system tables** | At minimum: `system.billing.usage` and `system.billing.list_prices` |
| **SQL warehouse** | A warehouse must be bound to the app. The recommended path is a SQL warehouse resource bound as `sql-warehouse` so the app receives `DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID` automatically |
| **Workspace Admin role** | Needed to create the app and, if required, remediate warehouse access |
| **Metastore Admin role, or access to one** | Needed to run the required Unity Catalog system table grants during setup |

#### Recommended warehouse

Use a **Serverless SQL warehouse**. The app is designed to read through a bound warehouse resource — add a `sql-warehouse` resource in app configuration rather than relying on manual runtime switching.

A **Medium** warehouse is a sensible starting point for initial table creation and normal dashboard usage. If you use Pro or Classic instead, expect slower startup and rebuild times.

#### Optional system tables

These are not required for the initial deployment, but they unlock additional parts of the app:

| Optional access | What it enables |
|---|---|
| `system.query.history` | SQL Warehousing views, query attribution, and warehouse rightsizing |
| `system.compute.clusters` | Cluster metadata and compute-oriented breakdowns |
| `system.lakeflow.*` | Job and pipeline name resolution and workflow KPIs |
| `system.serving.served_entities` | Model serving and AI/ML enrichment |
| `system.access.workspaces_latest` | Human-readable workspace names |

---

### Step 1 — Create the app from Git

> **Workspace preview required:** If you do not see a **Git repository** option when creating an app, enable it first: go to **Settings → Workspace Previews**, find **"Deploy Databricks apps from Git repositories (Beta)"**, and toggle it **ON**. This is a per-workspace setting and requires workspace admin access.

1. In your Databricks workspace, open **Apps**
2. Click **Create app**
3. Select **Git repository** as the source
4. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/smathews13/cost-obs-databricks`
5. Use the `main` branch
6. Give the app a name such as `cost-observability`
7. Click **Create**

---

### Step 2 — Bind the SQL warehouse resource and add SQL scope

Bind a SQL warehouse resource in the Apps UI so the warehouse ID is injected automatically. This is the recommended pattern for Databricks Apps and avoids manual warehouse wiring.

1. Open the app's **Settings** page (three-dot menu on the app card)
2. In **Resources**, click **Add resource**
3. Choose **SQL warehouse**
4. Select the warehouse you want the app to use
5. Set the permission to **Can use**
6. Leave the resource key as `sql-warehouse`
7. Under **User authorization**, click **Add scope** and add the `sql` scope
8. Save the configuration

---

### Step 3 — Review environment variables

The app keeps the initial deployment as simple as possible. For most customers, only these three variables are relevant. They are set at deploy time and are not intended to be changed inside the app UI.

> The SQL warehouse, workspace scope, and table location are configured once and held constant. If you need to change them, delete the app and recreate it.

| Variable | Default | Change if… |
|---|---|---|
| `COST_OBS_CATALOG` | Set by setup wizard | You want to pre-configure the catalog instead of choosing it in the setup wizard |
| `COST_OBS_SCHEMA` | Set by setup wizard | You want to pre-configure the schema name |
| `COST_OBS_WORKSPACES` | All workspaces | You want to scope the app to a comma-separated list of workspace IDs |

Keep the first deployment minimal. Add optional cloud-cost or advanced integrations only after the base app is healthy.

<details>
<summary>All environment variable overrides</summary>

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABRICKS_HOST` | Auto-detected | Override the workspace URL if not picked up automatically |
| `DATABRICKS_HTTP_PATH` | Auto-detected from resource binding | Point to an existing warehouse, or omit to use the bound resource |
| `COST_OBS_CATALOG` | Set by setup wizard | Unity Catalog catalog for app-managed tables. When set, takes precedence over the wizard value |
| `COST_OBS_SCHEMA` | Set by setup wizard | Schema name for app-managed tables. When set, takes precedence over the wizard value |
| `COST_OBS_WORKSPACES` | All workspaces | Comma-separated workspace IDs to scope the dashboard |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | — | Azure subscription ID (shown in account banner on Azure) |
| `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_*` | — | Email alert configuration |
| `AWS_COST_CATALOG` / `AWS_COST_SCHEMA` | `billing` / `aws` | AWS CUR actual cost tables |
| `AZURE_COST_CATALOG` / `AZURE_COST_SCHEMA` | `billing` / `azure` | Azure cost export tables |
| `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` | — | Only needed for **local development** |

</details>

---

### Step 4 — Deploy

1. Click **Deploy**
2. Wait for the app status to show **Running**
3. Open the app URL

The deployment installs dependencies, starts the backend, and serves the frontend. Once the app is running, the first-run setup flow begins.

---

### Step 5 — Complete first-run setup

On first open, the app checks the environment, validates permissions, and creates the app-managed tables.

#### 5a — Confirm readiness

The app shows whether the warehouse, core system tables, and optional feature dependencies are ready. If the app reports a missing dependency, remediate it before proceeding.

#### 5b — Complete the Setup Wizard

The built-in Setup Wizard handles grants and table creation on first run. You do not need to navigate into Settings manually for initial setup.

- **Grants:** The wizard attempts the required grants automatically using the permissions of the logged-in user. Click the grant button, then click **Re-check** to confirm they applied. If the automatic grant fails due to insufficient privileges, the wizard displays the SQL to copy and run manually as the appropriate admin.

- **Table build:** Once grants pass, the wizard prompts you to build the pre-aggregated tables used by the dashboard. Click **Build**. This runs in the background on your warehouse and typically takes 3–8 minutes.

- **Workspace filter:** If `COST_OBS_WORKSPACES` was not set at deploy time, the wizard prompts you to choose workspace scope before completion. If workspace IDs were set as an environment variable, this step is skipped.

If you need to re-apply grants or rebuild tables later, use **Settings → Permissions** and **Settings → Config**. These are the ongoing management surfaces after initial setup.

---

### Step 6 — Verify the deployment

After setup completes, confirm:

- The main billing views load
- Readiness is green for core dependencies
- Optional areas only show as unavailable if their supporting system tables were not granted
- No dashboard tile is blocked by a missing warehouse or system table grant

If anything is degraded, go to **Settings → Permissions** or **Settings → Config** to identify whether the issue is warehouse access, missing system table grants, missing app-managed tables, or a schema mismatch.

---

### Minimum access for end users

This deployment path uses the **app service principal** for SQL execution. End users do not need any additional authentication for normal app usage.

Use **Settings → Permissions** to manage who can administer or view the app.

---

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| Warehouse access failure after deploy | Warehouse resource missing, wrong warehouse selected, or access drift | Verify the bound SQL warehouse resource; rerun the warehouse-related remediation SQL if prompted |
| Billing tabs show no data | Core system table grants not applied | Run the required runtime grants from **Settings → Permissions**, then click **Re-check** |
| Optional tabs are unavailable | Optional system tables (`system.query.history`, `system.compute.clusters`, etc.) were not granted | Grant the optional dependencies you want to enable, then re-check readiness |
| Rebuild required or schema mismatch | App-managed tables are missing or out of sync | Rebuild from **Settings → Config** |
| Deploy from Git option not visible | Workspace preview not enabled | Enable the Git deployment preview in **Settings → Workspace Previews** |
| Data looks stale | App-managed tables have not been refreshed recently | Refresh from **Settings → Config → Rebuild** |

```

### Authentication

All dashboard queries run as the app's **service principal** (SP). The SP is automatically granted access to the required system tables during the setup wizard's Permissions step. End users do not need any additional authentication for normal app usage.

The catalog and schema created during setup are owned by the SP. The installing user receives `USE CATALOG`, `USE SCHEMA`, `SELECT`, and `MANAGE` grants automatically — giving them full visibility in the Unity Catalog browser and the ability to re-grant the SP on future redeploys.

### Data Sources

All billing and compute data is **account-level** — queries run against Unity Catalog system tables which span all workspaces in the account.

| System Table | Usage |
|---|---|
| `system.billing.usage` | Core spend/DBU data for all products |
| `system.billing.list_prices` | Standard SKU pricing for cost calculation |
| `system.billing.account_prices` | Negotiated/discounted account-specific prices (private preview) |
| `system.query.history` | SQL query attribution, source tracking, and rightsizing signals |
| `system.compute.clusters` | Cluster metadata, names, owners, ML runtime detection |
| `system.compute.warehouses` | Warehouse names, types, sizes |
| `system.lakeflow.pipelines` | SDP pipeline name resolution |
| `system.lakeflow.jobs` | Job name resolution |
| `system.lakeflow.job_run_timeline` | Job success/failure tracking for KPIs |
| `system.serving.served_entities` | ML endpoint metadata |
| `system.access.workspaces_latest` | Workspace name resolution |

### App-Managed Tables

The setup wizard creates **6 pre-aggregated Delta tables** in the Unity Catalog location you configure. These are the only persistent objects the app creates in your environment.

| Table | What it stores | Rows (est.) |
|---|---|---|
| `daily_usage_summary` | Total DBUs + spend per day | ~365 |
| `daily_product_breakdown` | DBUs + spend per day × product category | ~3,600 |
| `daily_workspace_breakdown` | DBUs + spend per day × workspace | ~3,600–36,000 |
| `sql_tool_attribution` | Genie vs DBSQL spend split per day × warehouse | ~730–7,000 |
| `daily_query_stats` | Query count, rows read, compute time per day | ~365 |
| `dbsql_cost_per_query` | Per-query cost attribution for the last 90 days | ~90k–900k |

Tables are built automatically when the setup wizard completes. The dashboard works immediately using direct system table queries while the background build runs (typically 3–8 minutes), then switches to the pre-aggregated tables automatically.

### Keeping Tables Fresh

Tables are automatically refreshed on a nightly schedule (default: 05:00 UTC). The scheduler runs incremental updates using MERGE INTO, so only new data is processed after the initial full build — refresh times after the first run are typically under a minute for most deployments.

The refresh frequency and scheduled time are configurable under **Settings → General**. Options include nightly (default) and every 6 hours.

To rebuild on demand, go to **Settings → Config → Rebuild**. This triggers a full rebuild of all 6 tables from the latest `system.*` data and typically takes 3–8 minutes. Progress is shown in real time.

Tables can be dropped and recreated at any time with no data loss — all source data lives in `system.*` tables managed by Databricks.

### Performance Optimizations

| Optimization | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Pre-aggregated Tables** | 6 Delta tables for sub-second dashboard loads |
| **Parallel Query Execution** | `ThreadPoolExecutor` (10 workers) runs 6–8 queries concurrently per bundle endpoint |
| **4-Hour Query Cache** | `TTLCache` with 500 entries — cost data changes at most once per day |
| **SDK Call Caching** | Pipeline names, group membership, and app registry cached for 1 hour |
| **Bundle Endpoints** | Single API call returns all data for a tab (reduces HTTP round-trips) |
| **React Query** | 30-minute stale time, 1-hour GC — prevents redundant refetches |
| **Lazy-Loaded Chunks** | Each heavy tab (Cloud Costs, AI/ML, Tagging, etc.) is a separate JS chunk loaded on first visit |

---

## Cloud Cost Integration

The Cloud Costs tab displays estimated infrastructure costs out of the box. It can also show **actual** AWS, Azure, or GCP billing data when configured. Full step-by-step setup instructions are built into the app — open the Cloud Costs tab and click **Set Up Actual Costs** to launch the in-app wizard.

### AWS (CUR 2.0)

The app reads from `billing.aws.actuals_gold`. Setup steps are available in the in-app wizard, and the table location can be overridden via `AWS_COST_CATALOG` / `AWS_COST_SCHEMA`.

### Azure (Cost Management Export)

The app reads from `billing.azure.actuals_gold`. Setup steps are available in the in-app wizard, and the table location can be overridden via `AZURE_COST_CATALOG` / `AZURE_COST_SCHEMA`.

### GCP (BigQuery Billing Export)

The app reads directly from your GCP billing export synced into a Databricks catalog via [BigQuery data sharing](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/delta-sharing/share-data-databricks). The default table is `billing.gcp.gcp_billing_export_v1` — override via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GCP_COST_CATALOG` | `billing` (or `COST_OBS_CATALOG`) | Catalog containing the GCP billing table |
| `GCP_COST_SCHEMA` | `gcp` | Schema containing the GCP billing table |
| `GCP_COST_TABLE` | `gcp_billing_export_v1` | Table name — use `gcp_billing_export_resource_v1` for resource-level detail, or `actuals_gold` if you have a pre-aggregated gold table |

Setup steps are available in the in-app wizard under Cloud Costs → Set Up Actual Costs → GCP.

## Security

- All dashboard API endpoints are authenticated by the Databricks Apps platform
- The `X-Forwarded-Email` header is used to identify the requesting user
- Settings mutation endpoints (cloud connections, webhook config, user permissions) require **admin role** — enforced server-side before any state change
- Webhook URLs are masked in API responses (never returned in plaintext after save)
