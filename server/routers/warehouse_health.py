"""Warehouse rightsizing and utilization recommendations.

Uses system.compute.warehouse_events, system.compute.warehouses, and
system.query.history to detect underutilized warehouses via three heuristics:
  1. IDLE_RUNNING  — warehouse running 2+ hours with no queries in 24h
  2. OVER_SCALED   — scaled to 2+ clusters but peak concurrency is low
  3. OVERSIZED     — large size with low queue wait and fast queries
